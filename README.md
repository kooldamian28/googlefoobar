Google Foobar Challenges (foobar.withgoogle.com)

These are all the Google Foobar challenges that I had completed.

Thank you!

If you're here still, you can trigger the Google Foobar by searching for "c++ move semantics" and going to Page 2 of results, then reloading 2-8 times, don't reload fast because it takes 4-5 seconds for the animation to appear.
If it doesn't work search for, in order, "mutex lock" and "arraylist java", in both the searches go to second page of search results and reload 2 times, then again search for "c++ move semantics" and go to the second page of search results, then wait for 3-4 seconds, if it doesn't appear, reload 2-8 times each at a interval of 4 seconds.
If it still doesn't work, this guide may be outdated because I'm writing it at 01/08/2020 at 3:07 PM (IST).

Thank you! (and pray for me and I will too!)
